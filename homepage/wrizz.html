        <h1> Sunset Diner</h1>
 <p>
    When you go to Sunset, there are a ton of smells, sights, noises, and tastes you’ll notice that all add into the experience at the diner. When you enter you’re immediately greeted with the noises of a box tv and all of the other customers enjoying their meals, although thats mostly blocked out by the chefs cooking in the kitchen. When you sit down you feel the wet tables that were just cleaned under your arms, and the warmth of the booth seat. It's like sitting in a booth a lawyer would in a TV show while getting their daily coffee, with all the warm orange and yellow colors covering the room. The smells of all the different foods being made in the kitchen spill into the rest of the diner, along with calls going back and forth between the cashier running the takeout phone to the kitchen. Sometimes you can hear little conversations in other booths or tables nearby, but usually you’re hearing a pen or pencil on a newspaper filling out a crossword puzzle. When you’re outside you can hear the cars on the highway buzzing, but as soon as you enter that all disappears. The second you hear the tiny ring of the bell hanging off the door.
    This place is similar to other diners because, well, they’re all diners. You get in a booth, order your food, eat, pay, and leave. Many other diners might even have similar aesthetics, with two similar colors painting the walls and ceiling, and the booths and menus matching that palette. But it’s different too, in a good way. Sunset is a much smaller diner, probably only twenty five~ people at a time. And there’s very few chefs in the kitchen, only about three or four. And unlike most diners or other establishments alike, Sunset never renovates. Everytime you go it’s gonna be the exact same building, the exact same lit up sign that can’t light up on command anymore, the same old TV that somehow has aged better than any other TV on the planet, and the food. The food has never changed, even when the chefs have. Somehow if you order the same order once every year after year, you’ll get the exact same thing no matter who’s cooking it. Hell I bet I could go back there and cook for myself, and I’d get exactly what I wanted. It’s like magic, if you sit at the bar in the right seat you can see into the kitchen and watch the chefs, and pretty isn’t the word I’d choose for it. It’s a gray room with no feel to it at all; just chefs cooking food.But when it goes through that window when it's ready it’s like it transforms into a work of art.
    The first time I went to Sunset Diner I must have been less than four years old. I probably don’t even remember the first time I actually went there- I was so young. But the first time I remember I still wasn’t in elementary school yet, and the place looked exactly the same as it does now. The cakes and other desserts under a light in the counter, the wet tables and the 2 registers, one at the door and one in the middle of the room. I don’t even think the menus have changed since I was first there, it’s always been the same exact brown-orange menu, perfectly fitting the color scheme of the rest of the diner. Every time we go it’s always a long twenty five-thirty minute wait for our food, giving time for you to sit and relax in a booth. Every time we go there’s always a fly sitting on the windowsill, no matter which window you are sitting at. But the waiting and the wet tables and the flies are all worth it for when your food comes. Going to Sunset is more than going to eat, it's going for the same hour-long experience time and time again, yet the experience changes every single time, whether it’s the food, the other customers, or what’s on the small TV hanging above the bathroom door.
